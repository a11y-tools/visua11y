# visua11y

visua11y is a Chrome extension that toggles accessibility (a11y) visualization apps from a popup menu
that you access by clicking on the 'v' button in the Chrome omnibar.

Each app highlights a targeted set of a11y-related elements on the page and provides a tooltip for
each element containing pertinent a11y information.

The apps included in visua11y are functionally identical to, and share the same codebase as the
bookmarklets available at https://github.com/oaa-tools/bookmarklets-library.
